# ðŸš€ Tech Stack

## 1. Frontend

- **HTML**  
  The standard markup language used to structure the web content. It's the backbone of any web page.

- **CSS (TailwindCSS)**  
  A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid, responsive, and customizable design. TailwindCSS helps in building UI components quickly without writing much custom CSS.

- **JavaScript**  
  The primary scripting language used to create dynamic, interactive web pages. It allows the frontend to handle client-side logic and asynchronous data handling.

- **socket.io-client**  
  A client-side library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server. It's often used for building chat applications, live updates, and other interactive features.

- **Zustand**  
  A state management library for React. It's lightweight and provides an easy way to manage global state in React applications, reducing the need for more complex solutions like Redux.

- **react-router-dom**  
  A library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define navigation paths, render components based on URL changes, and handle client-side routing in single-page applications.

- **Axios**  
  A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It's used to make requests to the backend API, enabling communication between the frontend and backend with ease.

- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**  
  A powerful JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. It's used for creating smooth, interactive animations in the UI, improving user engagement.

## 2. Backend

- **MongoDB**  
  A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is scalable and works well with the application's data structure, making it ideal for handling unstructured data.

- **Express**  
  A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware management. Express provides an easy-to-use set of features for building web servers and APIs.

- **Node.js**  
  A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It enables the use of JavaScript on the server side, allowing us to build scalable, non-blocking I/O applications.

- **Socket.io**  
  A library used to establish WebSocket-based real-time communication between the client and the server. It's essential for enabling real-time interactions such as live chats or instant notifications.

- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)**  
  A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's used for authentication and ensuring secure communication between the client and server by issuing tokens.

- **CORS**  
  A middleware that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the backend to securely accept requests from different origins. It's critical for handling requests from frontend applications hosted on different domains.

- **cookie-parser**  
  A middleware to parse cookies attached to the incoming requests. It's used to read cookies and manage user sessions securely.

- **bcrypt**  
  A password-hashing function to store user passwords securely. It helps in protecting user data by ensuring that plain-text passwords are never stored directly in the database.

- **Mongoose**  
  An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose provides a straight-forward schema-based solution to model the data, making it easier to work with MongoDB from Node.js.
